Explanation:

* *contact.new.user.event.listener*: unique key to avoid duplicate names.

* *addListenerPlugin*: This API of Organization service to allow other listener overwrite.

* *org.exoplatform.contact.service.impl.NewUserListener*: The object defines Contact Service to insert database.

* *description*: Some brief descriptions about plugin.

After Users for Contact are created and saved in eXo JCR, the function postSave() in org.exoplatform.contact.service.impl.NewUserListener  will be executed to create Contact and Address Book default for each user. This function also defines public contact group default basing on User's role. Each group contains contacts of User having the same role.

For example, users have administrator role are grouped in Administrator group, users have moderator role are grouped in Moderator group, users have normal user role are grouped in Users group.
So, when login into AdressBook Application by specific User, his/her default Address book, default Contact and many public contact groups are shown.
