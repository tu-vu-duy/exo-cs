h1. Calendar View



h1. Overview

You are able to personalize your Calendar View by different view types.

By default, Week view is set and displayed when the Calendar is opened the first time. You can change your view from the main tool bar to make it easy for you to see activities in your Calendar. However, changing the Calendar View from the main tool bar only affects on
the current session. The next time you go to eXo Calendar, the view will back to what has been set in your Calendar Settings.

To change your Calendar View, select one view type in the drop down list menu:
